To change the font of the framebuffer output you must only replace the
file 'font.bin' contained in the project. Take one of the fonts from
folder 'fonts', copy it into the project folder where the old file was
located and rename it to 'font.bin'.
You could take every other font which has size 8x16 pixel and is in a
binary format.
